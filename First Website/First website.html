<h1>Lucy M</h1>

<p>	I really enjoy theatre and want to persue it in the
futre with freelance programing as a background job to support myself.
I'd love to join a Shakespeare troop in the futre as a way to travel the world.</p>

<p>	A large part of my life is education as I have a deep love for learning.
I'm taking ten classes this year and plan to do the same next year after
completing two courses this summer as a way to get ahead.
These courses would be my math and science classes.</p>
